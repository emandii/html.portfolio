<h1>Best movies according to me</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>COCO</h3>
<p>
A fascinating animated movie; <br />
It's based on core values like family, friendship and courage.
</p>

<h3>CARS</h3>
<P>
Another great animated movie, probably the best one yet. <br />
It takes place in a Universe where human kind has gone extinct <br />
and cars took control of the world in the aftermath living human-like lives.</p>

<h3>I AM LEGEND</h3>
<p>
   A great film starring Will Smith in the role of "the lonely survivor"; <br />
   after a virus turned most of the population of New York into monsters <br /> 
he and his dog are the only ones left to save the human race.</p>
